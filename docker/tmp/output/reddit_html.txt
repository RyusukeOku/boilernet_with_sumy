 Should I buy the iphone 15 plus? 

    Hello everyone. I am thinking of buying the iphone 15 plus. I've read reviews from people and they all say it is a great phone. But what worries me is that now I have a phone that has 120hz and the 15 plus has a 60hz. Is the difference that noticable?? Anyone can give me their reviews on the 15plus?
  

    Update: hello!! I've read all your comments and almost all of you say that I will get used to the 60hz. Well turns out all this time I've been using the 60hz ðŸ˜‚ðŸ¤¦ðŸ�»â€�â™€ï¸�. One comment said to change the refresh rate from 120hz to 60hz on my phone to see the difference. I thought that I was using the 120hz because I was comparing the specs of my phone to the specs of the 15plus and I wasn't taking into account the changes in settings that I may have made. Well turns out I've always had it on 60hz and it is actually pretty fast. And if the 15 plus is the same at 60hz then it really won't be a problem. Thank you all for your responses!!
